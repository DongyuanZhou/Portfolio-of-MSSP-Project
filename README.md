# Portfolio-of-MSSP-Project
The purpose of this portfolio is to show my project experiences as a MSSP student on collaborative
consulting projects. Throughout two semesters, students in MSSP as well as teaching fellows formed the
consulting group and our services included free walk-in problem solving sessions, statistical application
consulting and long-term collaborative projects. We provided assistance with the following steps: Project
planning, selection of appropriate statistical methods, data analysis and evaluation of results, and report
and presentation development.
